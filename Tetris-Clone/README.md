# Tetris in Java

## Proposal Introduction

This project intends to implement the game of *Tetris* in java. Tetris is a simple game where the user (or the gamer) 
aims to place blocks of different shapes in appropriate places to clear levels and prevent blocks from stacking up 
as long as possible. I intend to bring a twist the original game of tetris by introducing three main functionalities:
- Regular Single Player mode where user 'clears levels' as long as possible at different difficulties
- Multiplayer Mode where two users are allowed to play simultaneously, attempting to play longer than the other user
- 'Multiplayer Mode', but with one actual player and one 'Computer' user where a pre-programmed tetris-solving algorithm.
User attempts to play for a longer time than the algorithm 

This project will be used by users who are interested in playing tetris, whether alone or with friends, or who wishes to 
challenge the tetris-solving algorithm. With tetris being one of the well-acclaimed 'classic' video games, I was 
particularly interested in programming an algorithm that solves the game of tetris, which is the primary reason why I 
chose this topic. 

## User Stories 
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple shapes (one at a time) to an instance of tetris.
- As a user, I want to be able to rotate and move a shape in an instance of tetris.
- As a user, I want to be able to clear a line and gain points by aligning blocks in an instance of tetris.
- As a user, I want to be able to create an instance of tetris with the choice of difficulty.
